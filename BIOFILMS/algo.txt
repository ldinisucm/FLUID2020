	abstract = {The polysaccharides associated with free (planktonic) and surface-attached (biofilm) cells from cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain B52 were compared. Variations in the attached matrix due to surface material (glass or stainless steel) were also analyzed. Two digestion methods were used to optimize the recoveries of sugars, uronic acids and acidic substituents. The yield of analyzable material after digestion reached 90\% for the material associated to the biofilms, though only 20â€“30\% for that bound to planktonic cells. The polysaccharide(s) in the biofilm had glucuronic and guluronic acids as main components, besides rhamnose, glucose and glucosamine. The proportion of glucuronic to guluronic acid was higher in the polysaccharide(s) found in biofilms formed on stainless steel than in those on glass.},
